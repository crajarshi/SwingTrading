# SwingTrading Score Calculation - Complete Guide

## Overview
The SwingTrading scanner uses a sophisticated scoring algorithm to rank stocks from 0-100, identifying the best swing trading opportunities. Higher scores indicate better setups for potential 3-8% gains over 2-10 days.

## The Four Scoring Components

### 1. Pullback Proximity (30% weight)
**What it measures:** How far the stock has pulled back from its recent 20-day high
**Formula:** `(1 - current_price / 20_day_high) * 100`
**Why it matters:** 
- Stocks that have pulled back 5-10% from recent highs often bounce back
- Too much pullback (>15%) might indicate real problems
- Sweet spot: 5-10% pullback scores highest

**Example:**
- Stock's 20-day high: $110
- Current price: $100
- Pullback score: (1 - 100/110) * 100 = 9.09
- This 9% pullback is ideal for swing trading

### 2. Trend Strength (25% weight)
**What it measures:** Stock's position relative to its 50-day moving average
**Formula:** `((current_price / SMA50) - 1) * 100`
**Why it matters:**
- Stocks above their 50-day average are in uptrends
- 5-10% above the average shows strong but not overextended
- Below the average might indicate weakness

**Example:**
- Current price: $105
- 50-day average: $100
- Trend score: ((105/100) - 1) * 100 = 5
- Being 5% above average shows healthy uptrend

### 3. RSI Headroom (25% weight)
**What it measures:** How much room the RSI has before becoming overbought
**Formula:** `70 - current_RSI`
**Why it matters:**
- RSI below 40 = oversold (high score potential)
- RSI at 50 = neutral (moderate score)
- RSI above 70 = overbought (low score)
- More headroom = more upside potential

**Example:**
- Current RSI: 35
- RSI headroom: 70 - 35 = 35
- Excellent headroom for upward movement

### 4. Volume Ratio (20% weight)
**What it measures:** Current volume compared to 10-day average
**Formula:** `(current_volume / 10_day_avg_volume) * 20`
**Why it matters:**
- Higher volume confirms price movements
- 1.5-2x average volume is ideal
- Too low volume = weak conviction
- Too high volume might mean news-driven

**Example:**
- Current volume: 1.5M shares
- 10-day average: 1M shares
- Volume score: (1.5/1) * 20 = 30
- 50% above average shows strong interest

## Final Score Calculation

```python
final_score = (
    pullback_score * 0.30 +
    trend_score * 0.25 +
    rsi_headroom * 0.25 +
    volume_score * 0.20
)
```

## Score Interpretation

### Score 70-100: EXCEPTIONAL SETUP üåü
- All indicators perfectly aligned
- High probability of success
- Use maximum position size (10% of portfolio)
- Entry: At or slightly above current price

### Score 40-70: STRONG BUY üü¢
- Most indicators favorable
- Good risk/reward ratio
- Standard position size (7-8% of portfolio)
- Entry: Current price + 0.2%

### Score 20-40: MODERATE BUY üü°
- Mixed signals but potential exists
- Smaller position size (5% of portfolio)
- Entry: Wait for slight pullback

### Score 10-20: WATCH LIST üëÅÔ∏è
- Not ready yet but monitoring
- Wait for better setup
- Entry: Only if score improves

### Score 0-10: AVOID ‚ùå
- Poor setup
- High risk, low reward
- Do not trade

## Real Example Walkthrough

Let's score **AAPL** with this data:
- Current Price: $175
- 20-day High: $185
- 50-day SMA: $170
- RSI: 38
- Current Volume: 75M
- 10-day Avg Volume: 60M

**Calculations:**
1. Pullback: (1 - 175/185) * 100 = 5.4% pullback ‚Üí Score: 5.4
2. Trend: ((175/170) - 1) * 100 = 2.9% above SMA ‚Üí Score: 2.9
3. RSI Room: 70 - 38 = 32 ‚Üí Score: 32
4. Volume: (75/60) * 20 = 25 ‚Üí Score: 25

**Final Score:**
```
(5.4 * 0.30) + (2.9 * 0.25) + (32 * 0.25) + (25 * 0.20)
= 1.62 + 0.73 + 8.00 + 5.00
= 15.35
```

**Interpretation:** Score of 15.35 = WATCH LIST
- Good RSI headroom (oversold)
- Decent volume
- But minimal pullback and weak trend
- Wait for better entry or stronger trend confirmation

## Why This Scoring Works

1. **Multi-factor approach:** No single indicator can fool the system
2. **Mean reversion focus:** Targets oversold bounces in uptrends
3. **Risk management built-in:** Avoids overbought and weak stocks
4. **Adaptable weights:** Can be tuned for different market conditions

## Configuration in config.yaml

```yaml
scoring:
  weights:
    pullback_proximity: 0.30  # Most important - finds the dip
    trend_strength: 0.25      # Confirms uptrend exists
    rsi_headroom: 0.25        # Ensures not overbought
    volume_ratio: 0.20        # Validates market interest
```

## Tips for Using Scores

1. **Don't chase:** If score < 10, wait for better setup
2. **Combine with news:** Check for earnings/events before trading
3. **Market context:** In bear markets, require higher scores (>20)
4. **Track performance:** Note which score ranges work best for you
5. **Patience pays:** Better to miss a trade than force a bad one

## Advanced: Adjusting for Market Conditions

### Bull Market (SPY RSI > 60)
- Lower score threshold acceptable (>10)
- Focus more on trend strength
- Smaller pullbacks still tradeable

### Bear Market (SPY RSI < 40)
- Require higher scores (>25)
- Focus more on RSI headroom
- Larger position in cash

### Sideways Market (SPY RSI 40-60)
- Standard scoring works best
- Equal weight to all factors
- Normal position sizing
